    This is the top-level directory of the stealth program source tree.

    The directory `sourceforge' is probably not useful for anybody but me, but
since it serves an important role for me in uploading the Stealth docs to
sourceforge, they belong to this project. The same holds true for the
stealth/debian directory. Since the construction of the Debian package is now
using the configuration files at
    https://svn.openfmi.net/debian-addons-bg/stealth
it is likely that the stealth/debian directory will at some point in the
future. 

    To create a source archive, run

        ./sourcetar

    This will create an archive named like stealth_1.45.tar.gz. 

    To create an `upstream debian archive' provide sourcetar with an (any)
    argument. E.g.,

        ./sourcetar deb

    This will create an archive named like stealth_1.45.orig.tar.gz

    The numbers will of course follow stealth's version.

    The `distribution' script is also probably not useful to anybody but me,
    and it may be removed from new distributions at some future point in time.

    
    To create the program from its sources, either descend into the stealth
    directory, or unpack a created archive, cd into its top-level directory 
    and follow the instructions provided in the INSTALL file found there.
