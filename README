To create a new stealth signed archive (which is probably obsolete, since the
debian source package should contain it all)

    rename stealth/ to stealth-X.YY

    cd stealth-X.YY

    buildmanpage
    buildmanual
    makedist

To create a new debian package:

    0. Do
        setenv DEBEMAIL f.b.brokken@rug.nl

    1. Keep the stealth/ name
    
    2. SKIP this item if the changelog has already been written, and a small 
        item was overlooked and the version wasn't tagged yet. Once it is
        tagged, this item MUST be executed as well:

        Define the next version/year in stealth/VERSION

        THEN (upgrade the version for each new distribution):

            cd stealth/debian
            dch -v [version just set in VERSION]
            cd ../..
        Last run:
            dch -v 1.32

    3. Build a new, complete, package:
        run on a clean checkout:
            (file:///usr/share/doc/maint-guide/
                maint-guide.en.html/ch-build.en.html#s-completebuild):

        From the directory where this file is located in, do:

        cvsremove
        cd stealth
        dpkg-buildpackage -mf.b.brokken@rug.nl -rfakeroot
        cd ..
        cvsrestore

    optionally:
        cvs commit 
        cvs tag v<version>-<revision>-<subrevision>

    4. Partial reruns (instead of full recompilation from scratch):
        run in stealth/

            fakeroot debian/rules binary

    or

        dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot
