The STEALTH program performs File Integrity Checks on (remote) clients. It
differs from other File Integrity Checkers by not requiring baseline integrity
data to be kept on either write-only media or in the client's file system. In
fact, clients will hardly contain any indication suggesting that they are
being monitored, thus improving the stealthiness of the integrity scans.


Stealth's repository has moved to https://gitlab.com/fbb-git/stealth
and is not maintained at this location anymore.
