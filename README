To create a new stealth signed archive (which is probably obsolete, since the
debian source package should contain it all)

    rename stealth/ to stealth-X.YY

    cd stealth-X.YY

    buildmanpage
    buildmanual
    makedist

To create a new debian package:

    1. Keep the stealth/ name
    
    2. Define the version:

    run in stealth/debian
        (file:///usr/share/doc/maint-guide/
                                    maint-guide.en.html/ch-update.en.html):

        dch -v <version>-<revision>
    
    Last run:
        dch -v 1.30-2a

    3. Build a new, complete, package:
        run on a clean checkout:
            (file:///usr/share/doc/maint-guide/
                maint-guide.en.html/ch-build.en.html#s-completebuild):

        From the directory where this file is located in, do:

        cvsremove
        cd stealth
        dpkg-buildpackage -mf.b.brokken@rc.rug.nl -rfakeroot
        cd ..
        cvsrestore

    4. Partial reruns (instead of full recompilation from scratch):
        run in stealth/

            fakeroot debian/rules binary

    or

        dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot
