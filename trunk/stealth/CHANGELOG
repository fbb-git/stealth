1.31

    Added options --suppress and --resume to allow logfile rotations
        --resume implies a --rerun
        --terminate can be used following --suppress

    Removed ::exit() and atexit() calls, using exceptions instead.

    Added `Monitor', containing all process-control functions previously 
        provided by Scanner itself. Scanner now only performs the scanning
        functions. 

1.20.2 (Debian) and beyond:
===========================

    See the debian changelog file for all changes as of version 1.20.2

1.20
====

Long options added (1.11), `LOG =' may be specified with CHECK commands.

Starting version 1.20, a Debian package is provided in parallel to the source
package. The Debian package contains the full documentation, as well as the
binary version of the stealth program. 

1.10
====

-i <time in seconds or minutes> option added: stealth will start its scan
somwhere in the random interval between now and the time specified after -i.
By default the time in seconds is expected. If at least an m is appended to
the time specificiation, the time specification is interpreted as time in
minutes (e.g., -i 5min)

1.01
====

DEFINE symbols accept other DEFINE symbols in their definitions. Direct or
indirect circular DEFINE definitions should be avoided by the policy's author.
The demo.pol policy file, the manual page and the manual was rewritten to
reflect this change.
The stealthmail script contained a stealth-version reference, which was
removed. 

1.00
====

Official release party (featuring coffee and pastries) at the computing center
of the university of Groningen, November 12, 2002. No changes in the software
or the docs, just a little celebration. Thanks, Hopko!
