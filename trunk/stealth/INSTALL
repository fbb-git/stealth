===========================================================================
To install stealth by hand instead of using the binary distribution perform
the following steps:

    0. The previously used scripts below make/ are obsolete and were removed
        from this and future distributions. Icmake should be used instead, for
        which a top-level script (build) and support scripts in the ./icmake/
        directory are available. Icmake is available on a great many
        architectures. See the file INSTALL (and INSTALL.im, replacing the
        previously used INSTALL.cf) for further details.

    1. Inspect the values of the variables in the file INSTALL.im Modify these
       when necessary.

    2. Make sure the bobcat library has been installed.

       (If you compile the bobcat library yourself, note that stealth does
        not use the classes Milter and Xpointer; they may --as far as stealth
        is concerned-- be left out of the library)

    3. Run 
            ./build program
        to compile stealth

    4. Run (probably as root) 
            ./build install
       to install. Optionally add an additional argument as a base directory
       below which the software should be installed. 

    Following the installation nothing in this directory tree is required
    for stealth's proper functioning, so consider removing it.
