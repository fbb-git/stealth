<h1 >Chapter 3: Granting access</h1>
Access to clients should be granted using the <code >ssh</code> protocol.
<p>
Clients must allow the monitor to connect using <code >ssh</code>. <strong >Stealth</strong> connects to its
clients using ssh certificates, after the monitor's public SSH-key has been
transferred to the clients.
<p>
<a name="l6"></a>
<h3 >3.0.1: The monitor's user: creating an ssh-key</h3>
        The monitor's user calling <strong >stealth</strong> to scan the client must first generate
an <code >ssh-keypair</code>:
        <pre>
    ssh-keygen -t rsa
</pre>
 
    By default this generates a public/private ssh key-pair in the directory
<code >.ssh</code> in the user's home directory. The program asks for a
<em >passphrase</em>. A passphrase can be defined (in which case it must be proviced
when <strong >stealth</strong> is started) or, if the security if the monitor is sufficiently
guaranteed, it can remain empty. To generate an ssh-key without passphrase
simply press <code >Enter</code> in response to the question
        <pre>
    Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
</pre>

    (a confirmation is required: just press <code >Enter</code> again).
<p>
<code >Ssh-keygen</code> then  returns a key fingerprint, e.g.,
        <pre>
    03:96:49:63:8a:64:33:45:79:ab:ca:de:c8:c8:4f:e9 user@monitor
</pre>

    which may be saved for future reference.
<p>
In the user's <code >.ssh</code> directory the files <code >id_rsa</code> and <code >id_rsa.pub</code>
are now created, which completes the preparations at the monitor.
<p>
If, instead of running <strong >stealth</strong> in daemon mode it is preferred to let <strong >stealth</strong> perform
single, but automated integrity scans, then new <strong >ssh</strong>(1) connections may be
difficult to establish if the used ssh-key is passphrase-protected. To
implement this scenario (i.e., automated integrity scans using passphrase
protected ssh-keys) the program <strong >ssh-cron</strong>(1) can profitably be used. 
<p>
<a name="l7"></a>
<h3 >3.0.2: The client's account: accepting ssh from the monitor's user</h3>
        Next, at the client's account where <strong >stealth</strong>'s <code >ssh</code> command connects to (see
also the <code >USE SSH</code> specification in section <a href="stealth04.html#USE">4.2</a>) ssh-access must be
granted to the monitor's user. To do so, the monitor user's file
<code >~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code> is added to the client account user's file
<code >~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>:
        <pre>
    # transfer user@monitor's file id_rsa.pub to the client's /tmp
    # directory. Then do:

    cat /tmp/id_rsa.pub &gt;&gt; /home/account/.ssh/authorized_keys
</pre>

<p>
This allows the user at the monitor to login at the account at the
client without specifying the client account's password (of course, if the
ssh-key is passphrase protected that passphrase must still be provided at the
monitor when starting <strong >stealth</strong>).
<p>
<a name="l8"></a>
<h3 >3.0.3: Logging into the account@client account</h3>
        When user@monitor now issues, for the first time, the command
        <pre>
    ssh account@monitor
</pre>

    <code >Ssh</code> responds like this:
        <pre>
    The authenticity of host 'monitor (xxx.yyy.aaa.bbb)' can't be
    established.
    RSA key fingerprint is c4:52:d6:a3:d4:65:0d:5e:2e:66:d8:ab:de:ad:12:be.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
</pre>

    Answering <code >yes</code> results in the message:
        <pre>
    Warning: Permanently added 'monitor,xxx.yyy.aaa.bbb' (RSA) to the
    list of known hosts.
</pre>

<p>
The next time a login is attempted, the authenticity question is not asked
anyore. However, the proper value of the host's RSA key fingerprint (i.e., the
key fingerprint of the <em >client</em> computer) should <em >always</em> be verified to
prevent <em >man in the middle</em> attacks. The proper value may be obtained at the
client by issuing there the command
        <pre>
    ssh-keygen -l -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub
</pre>

    This should show the same value of the fingerprint as shown when the
first <code >ssh</code> connection was established. E.g.,
        <pre>

    1024 c4:52:d6:a3:d4:65:0d:5e:2e:66:d8:ab:de:ad:12:be ssh_host_rsa_key.pub
</pre>

<h3 >3.0.4: Using the proper shell</h3>
        On order to minimize the amount of clutter and possibly complications when
only a simple command-shell is required for executing commands, it is
suggested to use a <strong >bash</strong>(1) shell when logging into <code >account@client</code>'s
account.
<p>
When another shell is already used for <code >account@client</code>, then an extra
account (optionally using the same <code >UID</code> as the original account, but using
<strong >sh</strong>(1) as the shell), could be defined in the client's <code >/etc/passwd</code>
file. In the <strong >passwd</strong>(5) file this could, e.g., be realized for <em >root</em> as
<em >rootsh</em> as follows:<br/>
        <pre>
    rootsh:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
</pre>

    If shadow passwording is used, a matching entry in the <code >/etc/shadow</code>
file is required as well.
