<h1 >Chapter 4: The `policy' file</h1>
    <strong >Stealth</strong> uses a policy file consisting of two sections, the second
section is optional, and starts at a line merely containing <code >%%</code>.
<p>
Each policy file is uniquely associated with a host to be tested. Each host
may have multiple policy files, though. In that case, each policy file defines
its own set of checks to be performed.
<p>
<ul>
    <li> The policy file's first section consists of two sets of data: <em >use
directives</em> (starting with the keyword <strong >USE</strong>) and <em >commands</em>. 
<p>
<li> The (optional) second section starts at a line merely containing
<code >%%</code>. Following this separating line several long option specifications can
be entered (cf. section <a href="stealth05.html#OPTIONS">5.2</a>). Options
specified on the command-line take priority over options specified 
in the policy file. Although the <code >--reload</code> option reloads the policy file,
it will not change option values originally specified as command-line options.
<p>
This section may contain specifications of the <code >skip-files</code> and <code >log</code>
options.  Relative file locations specified for these options are interpreted
relative to the location of the policy file. E.g., if the policy file argument
is specified as <code >/root/client/policy</code> then the specification <code >log:
client.log</code> results in <strong >stealth</strong> writing its logs into the file
<code >/root/client/client.log</code>.
    </ul>
<p>
The policy file's first section consists of three sets of data: <em >define
directives</em> (starting with the keyword <strong >DEFINE</strong>), <em >use directives</em>
(starting with the keyword <strong >USE</strong>) and <em >commands</em>.
<p>
Directives are written in capitals, and should appear exactly as written
below.
<p>
Blank lines and information beyond hash-marks (#) are ignored, while lines
following lines terminating in backslashes (\ ) will be concatenated (<em >en
passant</em> removing these backslashes). Leading white space on lines of the
policy file is ignored.
<p>
<a name="l11"></a>
<h2 >4.1: DEFINE directives</h2>
        <code >DEFINE</code> directives can be used to define symbols for longer strings.
A <code >DEFINE</code> directive is constructed as follows:
        <pre>
    DEFINE name     that what is defined by `name'
</pre>

    Here,
    <ul>
    <li> the <code >name</code> following <code >DEFINE</code> is the symbol that may be used in
<code >USE</code> directives (see below) and <code >commands</code> (see below). 
    <li> <code >DEFINE</code> symbols can be used in other <code >DEFINE</code> symbols. However,
it is the responsibility of the policy file's author to make sure that
(indirect) circular definitions are avoided. E.g., after:
        <pre>
    DEFINE A    ${B}
    DEFINE B    ${A}
    DEFINE C    ${C}

    USE MAILARGS ${A} ${B} ${C}
</pre>

    <code >MAILARGS</code> will be expanded to 
        <pre>
     ${A} ${A} ${C}
</pre>

    <li> The text following <code >DEFINE name</code> is then inserted literally into
the <code >USE</code> directive or <code >command</code>.
<p>
Example:
        <pre>
    DEFINE  SSH         /usr/bin/ssh frank@localhost -q
    DEFINE  EXECSHA1     -xdev -perm /111  -type f -exec /usr/bin/sha1sum {} \;
</pre>

    The symbols defined by <code >DEFINE</code> directives may consist of letters,
digits and the underscore characters (<code >_</code>).  In the definition of the symbol
any character can be used. However, initial and/or trailing blanks are removed
from definitions.
<p>
To insert a definition into a <code >USE</code> directive or <code >command</code> use the form
        <pre>
    ${name}
</pre>

    E.g., <code >${EXECSHA1}</code>. Concrete examples are provided below.
    </ul>
<p>
<a name="USE"></a><a name="l12"></a>
<h2 >4.2: USE directives</h2>
        <code >USE</code> directives provide <strong >stealth</strong> with arguments which
may be conditional to a certain installation. The following <strong >USE</strong> directives
are supported:
    <ul>
    <li> <strong >USE BASE</strong> <code >basedirectory</code>
<p>
<strong >BASE</strong> defines the directory from where <strong >stealth</strong> operates. All relative
path specifications in this section of the policy file are interpreted
relative to <strong >BASE</strong>. <em >By default</em> this is the directory where <strong >stealth</strong> was
started.
<p>
If necessary, <strong >stealth</strong> creates all <strong >BASE</strong> and other directories below
<code >BASE</code>. 
<p>
Example: using the specification
        <pre>
    USE BASE /root/client
</pre>

    results in all information generated by <strong >stealth</strong> being written in or below the
directory <code >/root/client</code>.
<p>
<li> <strong >USE DD</strong> <code >&lt;dd&gt;</code><br/>
        The <strong >DD</strong> specification uses <code >/bin/dd</code> as default, and defines the
location of the <strong >dd</strong>(1) program, both on the server and on the client. The
<strong >DD</strong> program is used to copy files between the client and the monitor
without creating separate ssh-connections. The <strong >DD</strong> program is only
used by <strong >stealth</strong> for the <code >PUT</code> and <code >GET</code> commands, described below.
<p>
Example showing the default:<pre>
    USE DD /bin/dd
</pre>

<p>
<li> <strong >USE DIFF</strong> <code >path-to-diff</code>
<p>
The <strong >DIFF</strong> specification uses <code >/usr/bin/diff</code> as default,
and defines the location of the <strong >diff</strong>(1) program. The
<strong >diff</strong>(1) program is used to compare a formerly created logfile of an
integrity check to a newly created logfile.
<p>
Example showing the default:
        <pre>
    USE DIFF /usr/bin/diff
</pre>

<p>
<li> <strong >USE DIFFPREFIX</strong> <code >&lt;prefix&gt;</code>
<p>
The <strong >DIFFPREFIX</strong> specification defines the size of the prefix added
by the <code >DIFF</code> command to lines produced by commands executed through <strong >stealth</strong>.
The default <code >/usr/bin/diff</code> program prefixes lines by either `<code >&gt; </code>' or
`<code >&lt; </code>'. The default value for <code >&lt;prefix&gt;</code> therefore equals 2.
<p>
Example showing the default:
        <pre>
    USE DIFFPREFIX 2
</pre>

<p>
<li> <strong >USE EMAIL</strong> <code >address</code>
<p>
The <strong >EMAIL</strong> specification defines the email-address to e-mail the
client's integrity scan report to. Mail is only sent when information has
changed.
<p>
Example showing the default:
        <pre>
    USE EMAIL root
</pre>

<p>
<li> <strong >USE MAILER</strong> <code >mailer</code>
<p>
The <strong >MAILER</strong> specification defines the program that is used to send
the mail to the <strong >EMAIL</strong>-address. By default this is <strong >/usr/bin/mail</strong>(1). 
The <strong >MAILER</strong> program is called as follows:
        <pre>
    MAILER  MAILARGS EMAIL
</pre>

    (<code >MAILARGS</code>: see below). The information to be mailed is read from
<code >MAILER</code>'s standard input stream.
<p>
Example showing the default:
        <pre>
    USE MAILER /usr/bin/mail
</pre>

<p>
<li> <strong >USE MAILARGS</strong> <code >arguments</code>
        The <strong >MAILARGS</strong> specification defines the arguments to be
to be passed to the <code >MAILER</code> program. By default this is 
        <pre>
    USE MAILARGS -s "STEALTH scan report"
</pre>
 
    Note that blanks may be used in the subject specification: use double or
single quotes to define elements containing blanks. Use <code >\"</code> to use a double
quote in a string that is itself delimited by double quotes, use <code >\'</code> to use
a single quote in a string that is itself delimited by single quotes. 
<p>
Subtlety: in constructions like 
        <pre>
    USE MAILARGS " 't was brillig " and 't went well
</pre>

    the following arguments are passed to <code >MAILER</code>:
        <ul>
        <li> <code >" 't was brillig "</code>
        <li> <code >and</code>
        <li> <code >'t</code>
        <li> <code >went</code>
        <li> <code >well</code>
        </ul>
    So, when single- and double-quoted strings overlap, the first string is
taken as a string, and the information beyond the first string is thereupon
interpreted. 
<p>
<li> <strong >USE REPORT</strong> <code >&lt;file-spec&gt;</code><br/>
        <strong >REPORT</strong> defines the name of the reportfile. Information is always
appended to this file. At each <strong >stealth</strong> integrity scan a <em >time marker line</em> is
written to the report file. Only when (in addition to the marker line)
additional information is appended to the report file the added contents of
the report file are mailed to the mail address specified in the <strong >USE EMAIL</strong>
specification. When a relative file specification is used it is interpreted a
location relative to the <code >USE BASE</code> specification.<br/>
    Example showing the default:<br/>
    <code >USE REPORT report</code>
<p>
<li> <strong >USE SH</strong> <code >&lt;sh&gt;</code><br/>
        The <strong >SH</strong> specification uses <code >/bin/sh</code> as default, and defines the
command shell used by the monitor to execute commands on itself. This must be
an absolute path specification.<br/>
    Example showing the default:<br/>
    <code >USE SH /bin/sh</code>
<p>
<li> <strong >USE SSH</strong> <code >&lt;user&gt;</code><br/>
        <strong >The SSH specification has no default</strong>, and <em >must</em> be
specified. This must be an absolute path specification.  
<p>
Assuming the client <em >trusts</em> the monitor (which is after all what this
program is all about, so this should not be a very strong assumption),
preferably the public ssh key of the monitor should be placed in the
client's root <code >.ssh/authorized_keys</code> file, granting the monitor root access
to the client. Root access is normally needed to gain access to all
directories and files of the client's file system.
<p>
In practice, connecting to an account using the <strong >sh</strong>(1) shell is
preferred. When another shell is already used by that account, one should make
sure that its shell doesn't define its own redirections for standard input
and standard output. One way to accomplish that is for force the execution of
<code >/bin/sh</code> in the <strong >USE SSH</strong> specification.
<p>
An example of an <code >SSH</code> specification to scan a localhost is:
        <pre>

    USE SSH root@localhost -T -q                # root's shell is /bin/sh
</pre>

<p>
The same, now explicitly using <code >/bin/bash</code>:
        <pre>

    USE SSH root@localhost -T -q exec /bin/bash # root uses another shell
</pre>

<p>
Alternatively, <code >--noprofile</code> can be specified to prevent any
profile-initialization: 
        <pre>

    USE SSH root@localhost -T -q exec /bin/bash --noprofile
</pre>
    
    </ul>
<p>
In some installations <strong >stealth</strong> is used to inspect the monitor itself, even
though this is <em >not</em> recommended, as it breaks one of the main reasons for
<strong >stealth</strong>'s existence. But in those situations (so, where <strong >stealth</strong> is used to monitor the
integrity of the <code >localhost</code>), <code >/bin/bash</code> could be specified at the
<code >USE SSH</code> directive. For example:
        <pre>
    # For stealth inspecting localhost:
        USE SSH /bin/bash --noprofile
</pre>

<p>
<a name="COMMANDS"></a><a name="l13"></a>
<h2 >4.3: Commands</h2>
        Following the <strong >USE</strong> specifications, <em >commands</em> can be specified. The
commands are executed in their order of appearance in the policy
file. Processing continues until the last command has been processed or until
a tested command (see below) returns a non-zero return value.
<p>
<a name="l14"></a>
<h3 >4.3.1: LABEL commands</h3>
            The following <strong >LABEL</strong> commands are available:
    <ul>
    <li> <strong >LABEL</strong> <code >text</code>
<p>
This defines a text-label which is written to the <strong >REPORT</strong> file,
just before the output generated by the next <strong >CHECK</strong>-command. If the next
<strong >CHECK</strong>-command generates no output, the label is not written to the
<strong >REPORT</strong>-file. Once a <strong >LABEL</strong> has been defined, it is used until it is
redefined by the next <strong >LABEL</strong> command. Use an empty <strong >LABEL</strong> command to
suppress printing labels.
<p>
The text may contain <code >\n</code> characters (two characters) which are
transformed to a newline character.
    <li> <strong >LABEL</strong>
<p>
As noted, this clears a previously defined <code >LABEL</code> command.
    </ul>
<p>
Examples:
        <pre>

    LABEL Inspecting files in /etc\nIncluding subdirectories
    LABEL
</pre>

    The latter <strong >LABEL</strong> command clears the text of the former <strong >LABEL</strong>
command.
<p>
<a name="l15"></a>
<h3 >4.3.2: LOCAL commands</h3>
            <strong >LOCAL</strong> commands can be used to specify commands that are 
executed on the monitor itself. The following <strong >LOCAL</strong> commands are
available: 
    <ul>
    <li> <strong >LOCAL</strong> <code >command</code>
<p>
Execute <code >command</code> on the monitor, using the <strong >SH</strong> command
shell. The command must succeed (i.e., must return a zero exit value). 
    Example:
        <pre>
    LOCAL mkdir /tmp/client
</pre>

    This command creates the directory <code >/tmp/client</code> on the monitor.
<p>
<li> <strong >LOCAL NOTEST</strong> <code >command</code>
<p>
Execute <code >command</code> on the monitor, using the <strong >SH</strong> command
shell. The command may or may not succeed.
    Example:
        <pre>
    LOCAL NOTEST mkdir /tmp/subdir
</pre>

    This command creates <code >/tmp/subdir</code> on the monitor. The command
fails if the directory cannot be created, but this does not terminate
<strong >stealth</strong>.
<p>
<li> <strong >LOCAL CHECK</strong> [<strong >LOG =</strong>] <code >logfile [pathOffset] command</code>
<p>
Execute <code >command</code> on the monitor, using the <strong >SH</strong> command
shell. The command must succeed. The output of this command is compared to the
output of this command generated during the previous integrity check run by
<strong >stealth</strong>.
<p>
The phrase <strong >LOG =</strong> is optional. When a relative file location is
specified at <code >&lt;file-spec&gt;</code> it is interpreted relatively to the <code >USE BASE</code>
path specification. 
<p>
<code >PathOffset</code> is also optional. If specified it defines the (0-based)
offset where path-names of inspected files start in lines produced by
<code >&lt;command&gt;</code>. By default <strong >stealth</strong> assumes that the first occurrence of a forward
slash defines the first character of the path-names of inspected files.
<p>
For example, if diff-output looks like this:
        <pre>

    01234567890123456789012345678901234567890 (column offsets, not part of 
                                               the diff-output)

    33c33
    &lt; 90d8b506d249634c4ff80b9018644567  filename-specification
    ---
    &gt; b88d0b77db74cc4a742d7bc26cdd2a1e  filename-specification
</pre>

    then the specification
        <pre>
    LOCAL CHECK logfile 36 command-to-be-executed
</pre>

    informs <strong >stealth</strong> where to find the filename specifications in the
diff-output. Using the standard <code >/usr/bin/diff</code> command, this offset equals
2 + the offset of the <code >filename-specification</code> found in
<code >command-to-be-executed</code>. 
<p>
If the command does not succeed a <em >warning</em> message is written to the report
file. The warning message informs the reader that `remaining results might be
forged:
        <pre>
    *** BE CAREFUL *** REMAINING RESULTS MAY BE FORGED
</pre>

    This situation may occur, e.g., if an essential program (like <code >sha1sum</code>)
was transferred to the monitor, and it was apparently modified since the
previous check. Processing continues, but remaining checks performed at the
client computer should be interpreted with <em >extreme</em> caution.
<p>
The output of this command is compared to the output of this command
generated during the previous run of <strong >stealth</strong>. Any differences are written
to <strong >REPORT</strong>. 
<p>
If differences were found, the existing <code >logfile</code> name is renamed to
<code >logfile.YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS</code>, with <code >YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS</code> the datetime-stamp at
the time <strong >stealth</strong> was run.
<p>
Over time, many <code >logfile.YYMMDD-HHMMSS</code> files could be accumulated.
It is up to the monitor's systems manager to decide what to do
with old datetime-stamped logfiles. For instance, the following script
removes  all <strong >stealth</strong> reports below the current directory that are
older than 30 days:
        <pre>
    #/bin/sh
    FILES=`find ./ -path '*[0-9]' -mtime +30 -type f`

    if [ "$FILES" != "" ] ; then
        rm -f $FILES
    fi
</pre>

<p>
The <code >logfile</code> specifications may use relative and absolute paths. When
relative paths are used, these paths are relative to <strong >BASE</strong>. When the
directories implied by the <code >logfile</code> specifications do not yet exist, they
are created first.
<p>
Example:
        <pre>
    LOCAL CHECK LOG = local/sha1sum sha1sum /tmp/sha1sum
</pre>

    This command will check the SHA1 sum of the <code >/tmp/sha1sum</code> program. The
resulting output is saved at <strong >BASE</strong><code >/local/sha1sum</code>. The program must
succeed (i.e., <code >sha1sum</code> must return a zero exit-value).
<p>
<li> <strong >LOCAL NOTEST CHECK</strong>  [<strong >LOG =</strong>] <code >logfile [pathOffset] command</code>
<p>
Execute <code >command</code> on the monitor, using the <strong >SH</strong> command
shell. 
<p>
The phrase <strong >LOG =</strong> is optional. When a relative file location is
specified at <code >&lt;file-spec&gt;</code> it is interpreted relatively to the <code >USE BASE</code>
path specification. 
<p>
The command may or may not succeed. Otherwise, the program performs exactly
like the <strong >LOCAL CHECK ...</strong>  command, discussed above.
<p>
Example:
        <pre>
    LOCAL NOTEST CHECK LOG=local/sha1sum sha1sum /tmp/sha1sum
</pre>

    This command will check the SHA1 sum of the <code >/tmp/sha1sum</code> program. The
resulting output is saved at <strong >BASE</strong><code >/local/sha1sum</code>. The program may or may
not succeed (i.e., <code >sha1sum</code> may or may not return a zero exit-value).
    </ul>
<p>
<a name="l16"></a>
<h3 >4.3.3: REMOTE commands</h3>
            Plain commands can be executed on the client computer by merely
specifying them. Of course, this means that programs called
<code >LABEL</code>, <code >LOCAL</code> <code >USE</code> or <code >DEFINE</code>, cannot be executed, since
these names are interpreted otherwise by <strong >stealth</strong>. It's unlikely that this
will cause problems. Remote commands must succeed (i.e., their return 
codes must be 0).
<p>
Remote commands are commands executed on the client using the <strong >SSH</strong>
shell. These commands are executed using the standard <code >PATH</code> set for the
<strong >SSH</strong> shell. However, it is advised to specify the full pathname to the
programs to be executed, to prevent ``trojan approaches'' where a trojan horse
is installed in an `earlier' directory of the <code >PATH</code>-specification than the
intended program.
<p>
Two special remote commands are <code >GET</code> and <code >PUT</code>, which can be used to
copy files between the client and the monitor.  Internally, <code >GET</code> and
<code >PUT</code> use the <code >DD</code> use-specification. If a non-default specification is
used, one should ensure that the alternate program accepts <strong >dd</strong>(1)'s <code >if=,
of=, bs=</code> and <code >count=</code> options. With <code >GET</code> the options <code >bs=, count=</code> and
<code >of=</code> are used, with <code >PUT</code> the options <code >bs=, count=</code> and <code >if=</code> are
used. Normally there should be no need to alter the default <code >DD</code>
specification.
<p>
The <code >GET</code> command may be used as follows:
    <ul>    
    <li> <strong >GET</strong> <code >&lt;client-path&gt; &lt;local-path&gt;</code><br/>
    Copy the file indicated by <code >client-path</code> at the client to <code >local-path</code>
at the monitor. <code >client-path</code> must be the full path of an existing file
on the client, <code >local-path</code> may either be a local directory, in which case
the client's file name is used, or another file name may be specified, in
which case the client's file is copied to the specified local filename. If the
local file already exists, it is overwritten by the copy-procedure.
<p>
Example:
    <pre>
    GET /usr/bin/sha1sum /tmp
</pre>

    The program <code >/usr/bin/sha1sum</code>, available at the client, is copied to
the monitor's <code >/tmp</code> directory. If copying fails for some reason, any
subsequent commands are skipped, and <strong >stealth</strong> terminates.
<p>
<li> <strong >GET NOTEST</strong> <code >&lt;client-path&gt; &lt;local-path&gt;</code><br/>
    Copy the file indicated by <code >client-path</code> at the client to <code >local-path</code>
at the monitor. <code >client-path</code> must be the full path of an existing file
on the client, <code >local-path</code> may either be a local directory, in which case
the client's file name is used, or another file name may be specified, in
which case the client's file is copied to the specified local filename. If the
local file already exists, it is overwritten by the copy-procedure.
<p>
Example:
    <pre>
    GET NOTEST /usr/bin/sha1sum /tmp
</pre>

    The program <code >/usr/bin/sha1sum</code>, available at the client, is copied to the
monitor's <code >/tmp</code> directory. Remaining commands in the policy file are
executed, even if the copying process wasn't successful.
    </ul>
<p>
The <code >PUT</code> command may be used as follows:
    <ul>    
    <li> <strong >PUT</strong> <code >&lt;local-path&gt; &lt;remote-path&gt;</code><br/>
    Copy the file indicated by <code >local-path</code> at the monitor to
<code >remote-path</code> at the client. The argument <code >local-path</code> must be the
full path of an existing file on the monitor. The argument <code >remote-path</code>
must be the full path to a file on the client. If the remote file already
exists, it is overwritten by <code >PUT</code>.
<p>
Example:
    <pre>
    PUT /tmp/sha1sum /usr/bin/sha1sum
</pre>

    The program <code >/tmp/sha1sum</code>, available at the monitor, is copied to the
client as <code >usr/bin/sha1sum</code>. If the copying fails for some reason,
any subsequent commands are skipped, and <strong >stealth</strong> terminates.
<p>
<li> <strong >PUT NOTEST</strong> <code >&lt;local-path&gt; &lt;remote-path&gt;</code><br/>
    Copy the file indicated by <code >local-path</code> at the monitor to
<code >remote-path</code> at the client. The argument <code >local-path</code> must be the
full path of an existing file on the monitor. The argument <code >remote-path</code>
must be the full path to a file on the client. If the remote file already
exists, it is overwritten by <code >PUT</code>.
<p>
Example:
    <pre>
    PUT NOTEST /tmp/sha1sum /usr/bin/sha1sum
</pre>

    Copy the file indicated by <code >local-path</code> at the monitor to
<code >remote-path</code> at the client. The argument <code >local-path</code> must be the full
path of an existing file on the monitor. The argument <code >remote-path</code> must
be the full path to a file on the client. If the remote file already exists,
it is overwritten by <code >PUT</code>. Remaining commands in the policy file are
executed, even if the copying process wasn't successful.
    </ul>
<p>
Other commands to be executed on the client can be specified as follows:
<p>
<ul>
    <li> <code >command</code>
<p>
Execute `<code >command</code>' on the client, using the <strong >SSH</strong> command
shell. The command must succeed (i.e., must return a zero exit
value). However, any output generated by the command is ignored. 
    Example:
        <pre>
    /usr/bin/find /tmp -type f -exec /bin/rm {} \;
</pre>

    This command will remove all ordinary files at and below the client's
<code >/tmp</code> directory.
<p>
<li> <strong >NOTEST</strong> <code >command</code>
<p>
Execute <code >command</code> on the client, using the <strong >SSH</strong> command
shell. The command may or may not succeed.
<p>
Example:
        <pre>
    NOTEST /usr/bin/find /tmp -type f -exec /bin/rm {} \;
</pre>

    Same as the previous command, but this time the exit value of
<code >/usr/bin/find</code> is not interpreted.
<p>
<li> <strong >CHECK</strong>  [<strong >LOG =</strong>] <code >logfile [pathOffset] command</code>
<p>
Execute <code >command</code> on the client, using the <strong >SSH</strong> command
shell. 
<p>
The phrase <strong >LOG =</strong> is optional. When a relative file location is
specified at <code >&lt;file-spec&gt;</code> it is interpreted relatively to the <code >USE BASE</code>
path specification. 
<p>
<code >PathOffset</code> is also optional, and has the same meaning as for the <code >LOCAL
CHECK</code> command, described above.
<p>
The command must succeed. The output of this command is compared to the
output of this command generated during the previous run of <strong >stealth</strong>. Any
differences are written to <strong >REPORT</strong>. If differences were found, the existing
<code >logfile</code> name is renamed to <code >logfile.YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS</code>, with
<code >YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS</code> being the datetime-stamp at the time <strong >stealth</strong> was run.
<p>
Note that the command is executed on the client, but the logfile is kept
at the monitor. This command represents the core of the method implemented
by <strong >stealth</strong>: there will be no residues of the actions performed by <strong >stealth</strong> on client
computers.
<p>
Several examples (note the use of the backslash as line continuation
characters):
    
        <pre>
    CHECK LOG = remote/ls.root  /usr/bin/find / \ 
            -xdev -perm /6111 -type f -exec /bin/ls -l {} \;
</pre>

    All suid/gid/executable files on the same device as the root-directory (/)
on the client computer are listed with their permissions, owner and size
information. The resulting listing is written on the file
<strong >BASE</strong><code >/remote/ls.root</code>. 
<p>
This long command could be formulated shorter using a <code >DEFINE</code>:
        <pre>
    DEFINE LSFIND   -xdev -perm /6111 -type f -exec /bin/ls -l {} \;
    CHECK remote/ls.root  /usr/bin/find / ${LSFIND}
</pre>

<p>
Another example:
        <pre>
    DEFINE SHA1SUM -xdev -perm /6111 -type f -exec /usr/bin/sha1sum {} \;
    CHECK remote/sha1.root /usr/bin/find / ${SHA1SUM}
</pre>

    The SHA1 checksums of all suid/gid/executable files on the same device as
the root-directory (/) on the client computer are determined.  The resulting
listing is written on the file <strong >BASE</strong><code >/remote/sha1.root</code>.
<p>
<li> <strong >NOTEST CHECK</strong>  [<strong >LOG =</strong>] <code >logfile [pathOffset] command</code>
<p>
Execute <code >command</code> on the client, using the <strong >SSH</strong> command
shell. 
<p>
The phrase <strong >LOG =</strong> is optional. When a relative file location is
specified at <code >&lt;file-spec&gt;</code> it is interpreted relatively to the <code >USE BASE</code>
path specification. 
<p>
<code >PathOffset</code> is also optional, and has the same meaning as for the <code >LOCAL
CHECK</code> command, described above. The command may or may not
succeed. Otherwise, the program acts identically as the <strong >CHECK ...</strong> command,
described above.
    Example (using the same <code >${SHA1SUM}</code>)definition:
        <pre>
    NOTEST CHECK LOG = remote/sha1.root /usr/bin/find / ${SHA1SUM}
</pre>

    The SHA1 checksums of all suid/gid/executable files on the same device as
the root-directory (/) on the client computer are determined.  The resulting
listing is written on the file <strong >BASE</strong><code >/remote/sha1.root</code>. <strong >stealth</strong> will
not terminate if the <code >/usr/bin/find</code> program returns a non-zero exit value.

<h3 >4.3.4: Preventing Controller Denial of Service (--max-size)</h3>
        Either by malicious intent or by accident (as happened to me) the monitor may
be a victim of a (self-inflicted) Denial of Service (DOS) attack. This DOS
attack may occur when the client (apparently) sends a never ending stream of
bytes in response to a <code >GET</code> or <code >REMOTE</code> command. Once one of my monitors
fell victim to this attack when a client's power went down and the monitor
kept on trying to read bytes from that client filling up the monitor's
disk....
<p>
This problem was of course caused by a programming error: while reading
information from a client <strong >stealth</strong> failed to check whether the reading had actually
succeeded. This bug has now been fixed, but an intentional DOS attack could
still be staged along this line when, e.g., the <strong >find</strong>(1) command is somehow
replaced by a manipulated version continuously writing information to its
standard output stream. Without further precaution <strong >stealth</strong> would receive a never
ending stream of bytes to be written to its `report' file, thus causing its
disk to fill up.
<p>
To prevent this from happening <strong >stealth</strong> now offers the <code >--max-size</code>
command line option allowing the specification of the maximum size of a stream
of bytes received by <strong >stealth</strong> (e.g., a report or downloaded file). The
maximum is used for each individual download and can be specified in bytes
(using no suffix or the <code >B</code> suffix), kilo-bytes (using <code >K</code>), mega-bytes
(using <code >M</code>) or giga-bytes (using <code >G</code>). The default is set at 10M,
equivalent to the command line specification of <code >--max-size 10M</code>. 
<p>
If a file or report received from the client exceeds its maximum allowed size
then <strong >stealth</strong> terminates after writing the following message to the report
file (which is sent to the configured mail address):
        <pre>
    
STEALTH - CAN'T CONTINUE: `&lt;name of offending file&gt;' EXCEEDS MAX. 
                                                DOWNLOAD SIZE (&lt;size shown&gt;)
    STEALTH - THIS COULD SIGNAL A SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH THE CLIENT
    STEALTH - ONE OR MORE LOG FILES MAY BE INVALID AS A RESULT
    STEALTH - *** INVESTIGATE ***
</pre>

    Since a <code >--max-size</code> specification may cause <strong >stealth</strong> to terminate
while receiving the output of a (remotely run) command, an empty or partial
log file will be the result. Of course this partial result is spurious as it
is a direct result of <strong >stealth</strong> terminating due to a size violation. 
<p>
After investigating (and removing) the reasons for the size violation a
new <strong >stealth</strong> run using the previous log file as the latest baseline should
show only expected changes.
<p>
For example, assume the following situation represents a (valid) state of
logfiles:
        <pre>
    etc                       stealth                   
    setuid                    stealth.20080316-105756
</pre>

    Now <strong >stealth</strong> is run with <code >--max-size 20</code>, prematurely 
terminating <strong >stealth</strong>. This results in the following set of logfiles:
        <pre>
    etc                       stealth
    setuid                    stealth.20080316-105756   
                              stealth.20080316-110215
</pre>

    The file <code >stealth</code> now contains incomplete data with the (latest) file
<code >stealth.20080316-110215</code> containing its previous contents.
<p>
The reasons for the size-violation should of course be investigated and
removed. It is suggested to move the file last saved
(<code >stealth.20080316-110215</code>) to the file <code >stealth</code>, as it represents the
state before the size violation was encountered. Following this <strong >stealth</strong> should
operate normally again.
