<h1>Chapter 2: Installation</h1>
This chapter describes <strong>stealth</strong>'s compilation and installation.

<h2>2.1: Compiling and installing Stealth</h2>
    After downloading the <strong>stealth</strong> archive, it should be unpacked. The name of
the archive is of the form <code>stealth-4.01.02.tar.gz</code>, where <code>4.01.02</code>
is a version number. Below, <code>4.01.02</code> should be altered into the version
of the archive that is actually used.
<p>
Required, non-standard software, for compiling <strong>stealth</strong> is summarized in the file
<code>required</code>, which is included in the source file distribution. Currently,
its contents are:
<p>
<pre>
This file lists non-standard software only. Thus, standard utilities like cp,
mv, sed, etc, etc, are not explicitly mentioned. Neither is the gcc compiler
explicitly mentioned, but a fairly recent one is assumed.

Required software for building Stealth 4.00.00
----------------------------------------------

libbobcat-dev (&gt;= 4.01.02),


To use the provided build-script:

    icmake (&gt;= 7.22.00)         

To construct the manual and map-page:
        
    yodl (&gt;= 3.05.0)

To construct the manual:

    texlive-latex-base,
    texlive-generic-recommended, 
    texlive-latex-recommended,
    texlive-fonts-recommended,
    cm-super-minimal,
    ghostscript


</pre>

<p>
<ul>
    <li> <strong>Stealth</strong> compilation is controlled by <strong>icmake</strong>(1). The program
maintenance utility <strong>icmake</strong>(1) can be obtained at
<a href="https://fbb-git.github.io/icmake/">https://fbb-git.github.io/icmake/</a>, and it is also available in several
Linux distributions (e.g., Debian, Ubuntu);
<p>
<li> Determine a directory where the files in <strong>stealth</strong>'s archive ashould be
stored. E.g., if the files in the archive should be stored under <code>/tmp</code>
(and assuming the archive itself is stored in <code>/tmp</code> as well) then do:
        <pre>

    cd /tmp
    tar xzf stealth-4.01.02.tar.gz
        
</pre>

    This creates a subdirectory <code>stealth</code> containing <strong>stealth</strong>'s sources;
<p>
<li> Change-dir to that directory:
        <pre>

    chdir stealth
        
</pre>

<p>
<li> Check the contents of the files <code>INSTALL.im</code> and <code>icmconf</code>, and
verify that all <code>#defines</code> match your computer's file system and
software. 
<p>
When compiling <strong>stealth</strong>, the
<a href="https://fbb-git.github.io/bobcat/">bobcat</a> header files must be
available. When <strong>stealth</strong> is run it is dynamically linked against the bobcat
library. <strong>Bobcat</strong> can be downloaded from 
<a href="https://github.com/fbb-git/bobcat/">https://github.com/fbb-git/bobcat/</a> (and follow its installation
instructions). Alternatively, bobcat may be available in your distribution,
(e.g.,  Debian or Ubuntu). Make sure to install both the run-time
(<strong>bobcat_...</strong>)  and the development (<strong>bobcat-dev_...</strong>) versions.
<p>
<li> Execute the command
        <pre>

    ./build program strip
        
</pre>

    This command by default creates the
program <strong>./tmp/bin/binary</strong>.
<p>
<li> To install <strong>stealth</strong> and its documentation, several commands are available:
        <pre>

   ./build install program [path] - installs the program as `path'
                                (by default as `/usr/bin/stealth')
   ./build install man [base]   - install the man pages below `base'
                                (by default below `/usr/share/man/man1')
   ./build install manual [base]- install the manual below `base'
                                (by default below 
                                    `/usr/share/doc/stealth-doc/manual')
   ./build install std [base]   - install standard docs below `base'
                                (by default below `/usr/share/doc/stealth')
   ./build install extra [base] - install extra docs below `base'
                                (by default below 
                                    `/usr/share/doc/stealth-doc')
        
</pre>
