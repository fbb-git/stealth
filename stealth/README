    * The manual is in the usr/share/doc/stealth/html  subdirectory. 
        Point your browser to its index.html or stealth.html file to start 
        reading the manual.
        The manual's sources are in the .../stealth/Yodl directory. 
        These are Yodl sources. Yodl is another Debian package.

    * The man-page stealth.1 is in usr/share/man/man1. 
        The file .../stealth/manpage/stealth.yo is the (Yodl) source file 
        which was used to construct the manpage. 
        
    * The standard way to compile stealth is using the provided `build'
      script, which is an `icmake' script (see the next item). 

    * To compile from scratch, run 
            ./build program 
      from this directory. The file INSTALL.im in this directory contains the
      definitions of variables defining the locations of the directories in
      which the binary, the man-page and the manual will be stored. Changing
      these definitions will install files in other locations.

    * To install `by hand', you should probably be `root'. Running (as root) 
            ./buidl install /
      installs the files ready for system-wide usage.

    * Remark, comments please to my email addres. The software is GPL, the
        copyright rests with me. This is to make sure that the most recent

        will be seriously considered, and if possible, incorporated in the 
        next version of the program.
