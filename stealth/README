    * The manual is in the usr/share/doc/stealth/html  subdirectory. 
        Point your browser to its index.html or stealth.html file to start 
        reading the manual.
        The manual's sources are in the .../stealth/Yodl directory. 
        These are Yodl sources. Yodl is another Debian package.

    * The man-page stealth.1 is in usr/share/man/man1. 
        The file .../stealth/manpage/stealth.yo is the (Yodl) source file 
        which was used to construct the manpage. 
        
    * To compile from scratch, run make/program from this directory. The file
      INSTALL.cf in this directory contains the definitions of shell variables
      defining the locations of the directories in which the binary, the
      man-page and the manual will be stored. Changing these definitions will
      install files in other locations.

    * To install `by hand', you should probably be `root'. Running (as root) 
      `./make/install /' installs the files ready for system-wide usage.

    * Remark, comments please to my email addres. The software is GPL, the
        copyright rests with me. This is to make sure that the most recent
        version is always with me. All suggestions for improvements
        will be seriously considered, and if possible, incorporated in the 
        next version of the program.
