    * The manual is in the usr/share/doc/stealth/html  subdirectory. 
        Point your browser to its index.html or stealth.html file to start 
        reading the manual.
        The manual's sources are in the .../stealth/Yodl directory. 
        These are Yodl sources. Yodl is another Debian package.

    * The man-page stealth.1 is in usr/share/man/man1. 
        The file .../stealth/manpage/stealth.yo is the (Yodl) source file 
        which was used to construct the manpage. 
        
    * The program was compiled on Linux 2.4.20, using the Gnu g++ compiler
        version 3.2.1

    * The program was compiled using an icmake `build' script. 
        Icmake is available as yet another Debian package.

    * The provided `plain' script in the source distribution can also be
        used to compile the program.

    * Remark, comments please to my email addres. The software is GPL, but the
        copyright rests with me. This is to make sure that the most recent
        version is always with me. All suggestions for improvements
        will be seriously considered, and if possible, incorporated in the 
        next version of the program.

    * At the same location where you found this archive, you should have found
        a detached signature file, as well as a file named

                                 stealth-V.VV.md5

        This file contains the md5sum of the stealth archive, signed with my
        private PGP key. V.VV stands for the version of the archive/program
        associated with the key. E.g., stealth-0.90.md5.

        Use my public key to verify the authenticity of the
        key. My public key was signed by the CA of the University of
        Groningen. Here are a PGP key server, and my PGP public key
        fingerprint:

    Public PGP key: http://www.pca.dfn.de/eng/dfnpca/pgpkserv/
    Key Fingerprint: 8E36 9FC4 1DAA FCDF 1A0D  B19F DAC4 BE50 38C6 6170

        Contact me if you have any doubts about the correctness of the 
    provided md5 sum or the given fingerprint.
