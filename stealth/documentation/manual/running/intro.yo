Now that bf(stealth) has been compiled, the construction of a policy file has
been covered, and a service-account on the client has been defined, what must
be done to run bf(stealth) in practice?

Here's what remains to be done:
    itemization(
    it() Install bf(stealth) at a proper location
    it() Construct one or more policy files
    it() Learn to interpret bf(stealth)'s output.
    it() Optionally, automate the removal of old log-files.
    it() Determine a schedule for running stealth automatically, e.g. using
        bf(cron)(1)
    )
    In this chapter, these topics will be discussed.
