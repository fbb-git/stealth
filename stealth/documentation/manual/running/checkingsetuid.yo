    Having checked the client's tt(sha1sum) and tt(find) programs, sha1 checksum
checks should be performed on all setuid and setgid files on the
client. For this we activate the tt(sha1sum) program on the client. In
order to check the setuid/setgid files, the following command is added to the
policy file:
        verb(    LABEL \nsuid/sgid/executable files uid or gid root on the / partition     
    CHECK LOG = remote/setuidgid /usr/bin/find / ${EXECSHA1})
