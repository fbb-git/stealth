As s() is mainly a system administrator's tool, it could be
installed in tt(/usr/bin). In that case, do (as em(root)) from the
directory where s() was compiled/unpacked:
        verb(    ./build install program)
    Alternatively, another default location may be specified in the
tt(INSTALL.im) file or may be provided to the tt(build) script. E.g.,
        verb(    ./build install program /usr/local/bin/stealth)
    installing the binary program as tt(/usr/local/bin/stealth).
