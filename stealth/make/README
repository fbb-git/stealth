The scripts in these directory are support-script for program maintenance.

Normally, only the following scripts should be called from this directory's
parent directory:

    clean   - as ./make/clean   to clean up remnants of previous compilation
                                etc. tasks When STEALTH=minimal is set, only 
                                a minimal cleanup is performed

    program - as ./make/program to construct the libstealth library and the 
                                tmp/sbin/stealth program

    install  - as ./make/install to install the software in the locations
                                indicated by the INSTALL.cf file (found in 
                                this directory's parent directory)

Support scripts called by the `program' script are:

    library     - constructs libstealth.a

    man         - constructs the man-page in tmp/man and tmp/manhtml

    manual      - constructs the manual in tmp/manual using yodl.

    parameters  - defines project name and compiler/linker options

    substitutions - defines the names of the library, the program source, etc.
                    from the definitions given in `parameters'

    special     - performs special tasks: creates release.yo and release.h
