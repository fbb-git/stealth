Description: A stealthy File Integrity Checker
 The STEALTH program performs File Integrity Checks on (remote) clients. It
 uses standard available software to perform file integrity checks (like
 find(1) and md5sum(1)). Using individualized policy files, it is highly
 adaptable to the specific requirements of its clients.
 .
 In production environments STEALTH should be run from an isolated computer. 
 I.e., a computer which does not accept incoming connections. 
 .
 STEALTH itself uses SSH connections to set up secure communication with its
 remote clients, and may send e-mail to remote clients system's maintainers.
 .
 The onset of STEALTH runs may be randomized, thus further increasing its
 stealthy characteristics.
 .
 STEALTH's acronym is expanded to `Ssh-based Trust Enforcement Acquired
 through a Locally Trusted Host'
