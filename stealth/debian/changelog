stealth (1.41) unstable; urgency=low

  * Library requirement up-to-date: bobcat 1.6.0

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Mon, 26 Dec 2005 19:17:24 +0100

stealth (1.40) unstable; urgency=low

  * all local Pattern objects are now static data members

    removed: superfluous stealth.doc-base; debugmacro;
    classes arg, configfile, errno fdout fork ifdnbuf pattern pipe selector
    (now in bobcat)
    
    Renamed all .h2 headers to my standard .ih names:
            util, configsorter, reporter scanner
    
    Reporter::reset() now calls Reporter::rewind()
    
    Reporter uses d_hasMail data member instead of d_sizeBeyondHeader:
    d_hasMail can simply be set to false following the writing of the header,
    and then to true at each sync() command.
    
    added: Reporter::exit(), first inserting the message into the reporter,
    then to cerr, and exiting.
    
    fatal error messages are no longer suppressed with -q

    man(ual) pages adapted accordingly.

stealth (1.35) unstable; urgency=low

  * Recompilation using g++-4.0. Requires bobcat >= 1.4.0

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Sat, 19 Nov 2005 16:47:28 +0100

stealth (1.34) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed dependencies on `icmake'. See the file `INSTALL' for details about
    compiling and installing `stealth' from the source package, rather than
    from the binary (.deb) package. 
    Stealth's functionality has not been altered.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Sun,  4 Sep 2005 15:11:46 +0200

stealth (1.33) unstable; urgency=low

  * With the advent of the bobcat library (Brokken's Own Base Classes And
    Templates) various classes were removed from stealth's distribution: Arg,
    Configfile, Errno, Fork, Hashclasses, Ifdstreambuf, Ofdbuf, Pattern, and
    Pipe. Also, the manual pages were adapted to reflect the fact that I'm
    distributing Debian (source and binary) packages, rather than pure source
    packages. No further change in functionality was implemented. To compile
    stealth bobcat-dev is required, to run the binary bobcat itself. See
    http://bobcat.sourceforge.net and http://sourceforge.net/projects/bobcat
    for further information about bobcat.

stealth (1.32) unstable; urgency=low

  * Version 1.31 was not distributed. Version 1.32 offers identical user
    options as V 1.31, but has some minor internal improvements in its code
    over 1.31. In particular, a running stealth process will signal its
    suppressor that it's ready. This simplifies the construction of, e.g., 
    logrotate scripts.

    Note btw that the date and timestamps in this file are CET (+ DST when
    active)

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Mon,  1 Aug 2005 10:49:36 +0200

stealth (1.31) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added --suspend and --resume options allowing logfile rotations on a
    keepalive running stealth process. Changed the manual page using standard
    manpage*() macros instead of SUBST()s

    Internally, a Monitor class was added, exercising and taking over  much of
    the control functionality of the Scanner class

stealth (1.30-2a) unstable; urgency=low

  * Stupid: forgot to update the program's version itself :-( 
    Now it's 1.30-2a

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Tue, 27 Apr 2004 17:56:54 +0200

stealth (1.30-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Repaired bug in Scanner::Scanner():
    The process-id's of the SH and SSH programs were assigned before
    IOFORK::fork() was executed, so they received undefined values. This was
    repaired by assigning the d_shPid and d_sshPid assignments to the
    Scanner::preamble() function.

    Also, the call to killChildren() at the end of stealth's main() function
    (in stealth.cc) was superfluous, as the atexit() call in preamble already
    ensures that the childprocesses are called.

    Finally, the Yodl manual files are adapted to Yodl V. >= 2.00. The
    /usr/local/share/yodl/macros.yo file isn't required anymore, and the
    XXsloppyhfuzz undefinition was changed into a call of nosloppyhfuzz().

stealth (1.30-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * --keep-alive, --terminate and --rerun require the name of a file in which 
    the process id of the running stealth process is stored. This file will be
    writen when the --keep-alive flag is used, read by the other two and
    removed by the corresponding stealth process when it terminates. Manpages
    and docs updated accordingly.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Wed, 17 Dec 2003 09:21:11 +0100

stealth (1.30) unstable; urgency=low

  * --terminate, --rerun, --repeat and --keep-alive flags were added to allow
    stealth to keep an existing connection for longer periods of
    time. Manpages and docs updated accordingly

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Fri, 12 Dec 2003 12:45:45 +0100

stealth (1.22-0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added GET and PUT. Put allows stealth to put files to the client using
    the existing ssh connection.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Wed, 26 Nov 2003 21:25:02 +0100

stealth (1.21-0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added the GET command, allowing stealth to retrieve files from the client
    for, e.g., local inspection, without requiring an additional ssh
    connection.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Sat, 22 Nov 2003 13:55:40 +0100

stealth (1.20-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * New buildscripts added for man(ual) pages. This file will take over from
    CHANGELOG which logged the original, non-Debian distribution. 

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rc.rug.nl>  Fri, 20 Jun 2003 17:21:42 +0200

stealth (1.20-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Release.
