stealth (1.30-2a) unstable; urgency=low

  * Stupid: forgot to update the program's version itself :-( 
    Now it's 1.30-2a

stealth (1.30-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Repaired bug in Scanner::Scanner():
    The process-id's of the SH and SSH programs were assigned before
    IOFORK::fork() was executed, so they received undefined values. This was
    repaired by assigning the d_shPid and d_sshPid assignments to the
    Scanner::preamble() function.

    Also, the call to killChildren() at the end of stealth's main() function
    (in stealth.cc) was superfluous, as the atexit() call in preamble already
    ensures that the childprocesses are called.

    Finally, the Yodl manual files are adapted to Yodl V. >= 2.00. The
    /usr/local/share/yodl/macros.yo file isn't required anymore, and the
    XXsloppyhfuzz undefinition was changed into a call of nosloppyhfuzz().

stealth (1.30-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * --keep-alive, --terminate and --rerun require the name of a file in which 
    the process id of the running stealth process is stored. This file will be
    writen when the --keep-alive flag is used, read by the other two and
    removed by the corresponding stealth process when it terminates. Manpages
    and docs updated accordingly.

stealth (1.30) unstable; urgency=low

  * --terminate, --rerun, --repeat and --keep-alive flags were added to allow
    stealth to keep an existing connection for longer periods of
    time. Manpages and docs updated accordingly

stealth (1.22-0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added GET and PUT. Put allows stealth to put files to the client using
    the existing ssh connection.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <frank@oostum.north>  Wed, 26 Nov 2003 21:25:02 +0100

stealth (1.21-0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added the GET command, allowing stealth to retrieve files from the client
    for, e.g., local inspection, without requiring an additional ssh
    connection.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <frank@oostum.north>  Sat, 22 Nov 2003 13:55:40 +0100

stealth (1.20-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * New buildscripts added for man(ual) pages. This file will take over from
    CHANGELOG which logged the original, non-Debian distribution.

stealth (1.20-1) unstable; urgency=low
