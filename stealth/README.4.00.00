With Stealth 4.00.00 existing policy files used with Stealth 3.00.00 can
remain as-is, although a run- or pid-file is no longer used. Instead, a Unix
Domain Socket is used for communication between a Stealth daemon and Stealth
running in IPC mode. 

For cosmetic reasons consider using xxx.uds instead of xxx.run or xxx.pid.

Logrotate.d scripts should use the 'copytruncate' and 'sharedscripts' options
(see the man-page for an example). These options should have been used with
earlier Stealth versions too, but were overlooked until now (sorry about
that). 

If access to the Unix Domain Socket defined by Stealth running in daemon mode
should be restricted, it can be defined in a directory with is only accessible
to the user running Stealth (this will often be the root-user).
