===========================================================================
To install stealth by hand instead of using the binary distribution perform
the following steps:

    0. Reverted back to using icmake. It is assumed that icmake is installed
       on your system if you want to compile stealth yourself. If not, and
       you don't install icmake: for the time being the make/ scripts are
       maintained, but they may be removed in future releases.


    1. Inspect the values of the variables in the file INSTALL.im Modify these
       when necessary.  In particular note the definition of the COMPILER
       variable, which is set to Gnu's g++ compiler as used in Debian's
       `unstable' distribution. Redefining COMPILER as `g++', should result in
       you using your default g++ compiler.


    2. Make sure the bobcat library has been installed.

       (If you compile the bobcat library yourself, note that stealth does
        not use the classes Milter and Xpointer; they may --as far as stealth
        is concerned-- be left out of the library)

    3. Run `./build program' to compile stealth

    4. Run (probably as root) ./build install 
       to install

    Following the installation nothing in this directory tree is required
    for the proper functioning of stealth, so consider removing it.
