===========================================================================
To Install stealth by hand instead of using the binary distribution perform
the following steps:

    1. Inspect the values of the variables in the file INSTALL.cf
       Modify these when necessary.

    2. Make sure the bobcat library has been installed.

    3. Run `./make/program' to compile stealth

        Note: it's NOT `make program'
    
    4. Run (probably as root) ./make/install to install

        Note: it's NOT `make install'

    Following the installation nothing in this directory tree is required
    for the proper functioning of stealth, so consider removing it.
