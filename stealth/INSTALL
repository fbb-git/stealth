===========================================================================
To Install stealth by hand instead of using the binary distribution perform
the following steps:

    1. Inspect the values of the variables in the file INSTALL.cf Modify these
       when necessary.  In particular note the definition of the COMPILER
       shell variable, which is set to Gnu's g++ compiler as used in Debian's
       `unstable' distribution. Removing the definition using the explicit
       version results in the definition of COMPILER as `g++', which should be
       your default g++ compiler.

    2. Make sure the bobcat library has been installed.

       (If you compile the bobcat library yourself, note that bisonc++ does
        not use the classes Milter and Xpointer; they may --as far as stealth
        is concerned-- be left out of the library)

    3. Run `./make/program' to compile stealth

        Note: it's NOT `make program'
    
    4. Run (probably as root) ./make/install to install

        Note: it's NOT `make install'

    Following the installation nothing in this directory tree is required
    for the proper functioning of stealth, so consider removing it.
