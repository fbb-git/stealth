Stealth:    handles the integrity scan or handles the communication with a
            running stealth daemon.

Options:    singleton, prepares all options received either on the command
            line or found in the policy file. Ends the program if incompatible
            options were specified. Initialized by Stealth::Stealth()

PolicyFile: processes (through its member 'reload') the first section of the
            policy file.

IPC:        handles the runfile (pid file): requests are written to the
            runfile followed by signaling the daemon through its member
            'signalDaemon'

RunMode:    keeps track of the currently active Stealth mode. A mode may also
            be queried, and the name of a mode can be requested. When a mode
            is changed, setMode is used to update RunMode's mode.

StealthLog: Handles all logs. d_stealthLog in the Stealth object is a stream
            into which log messages can be inserted. 

Msg:        m1..m3 insert messages depending on verbosity level. mp is used
            for messages related to parsing the policy file. These are global
            objects. Other than the m-objects imsg, wmsg and fmsg can also be
            used.

StealthEnums: struct StealthEnums is empty, defining the enum Mode and the
            Mode | Mode operator.
