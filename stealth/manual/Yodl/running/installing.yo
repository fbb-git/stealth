As bf(stealth) is mainly a system administrator's tool, it could be
installed in tt(/usr/local/bin). In that case, do (as em(root)) from the
directory where bf(stealth) was compiled/unpacked:
        verb(
    install stealth /usr/local/bin
        )
    options given to bf(install)(1) may restrict further use of bf(stealth).
