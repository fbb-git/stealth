sect(Installing `stealth')

As tt(stealth) is mainly a system administrator's tool, it could be
installed in tt(/usr/local/sbin). In that case, do (as em(root)) from the
directory where tt(stealth) was compiled/unpacked:
        verb(
    install stealth /usr/local/sbin
        )
    options given to bf(install)(1) may restrict further use of tt(stealth).
