stealth (2.01.00)

  * Stealthcleanup now has a -v flag, showing its actions

  * Following an upgrade to bobcat 2.11.00 stealth should be recompiled

  * Identifiers in #defines in configuration files may now also contain 
    hyphens and underscores.

  * The message about 'can't read Mstream...' when stealth started with
    --keep-alive is now prevented

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Sat, 05 Feb 2011 12:38:23 +0100

stealth (2.00.1)

  * Documentation requires >= Yodl 3.00.0

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Wed, 10 Nov 2010 10:38:49 +0100

stealth (2.00.0)

  * Changed Errno::what() call to Errno::why()
  * Repaired handling of the -o flag (wasn't working: checked for option "o"
    rather than 'o'.
  * Implemented option -s (--skip-files) to skip the integrity-test of
    specified files. When appearing in the logs so far the initial appearance
    of a path in the file containing the files to skip results in a
    log-message "SKIPPING"
  * A full overhaul of Stealth's sources warrants an upgrade of the major
    version to 2.
  * replacing Msg by Mstream and Errno facilities
  * NOTE: requires bobcat 2.09.00 or later

stealth (1.47.4)

  * Added g++ option --std=c++0x to match the latest Bobcat library
  * Stealth is now by default installed in /usr/bin (instead of /usr/sbin) as
    non-root users are also able to use stealth, e.g., to monitor the
    integrity of their own files. Stealth support scripts (stealthcleanup,
    stealthcron, stealthmail) are found by default in in
    /usr/share/doc/stealth/scripts/usr/bin and you might want to install them
    in /usr/bin rather than /usr/sbin, as suggested previously.

    **MAKE SURE** that `/sbin/' is changed to `/bin/' in any scripts you may
    use to activate stealth (e.g. /etc/cron.d/stealth, calling stealthcron)

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Thu, 03 Sep 2009 13:52:38 +0200

stealth (1.47.3)

  * Build script's `manual-tmp' removed, reactivated `manual'. Build now
    allows separate installation of program, man-page and manual

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Mon, 30 Mar 2009 09:53:39 +0200
    
stealth (1.47.2)

  * Minor changes wrt Process object definitions to prevent `obsolete'
    warnings from by now (since bobcat 1.21.1) obsolete Process
    constructors. Also, the Process mail constructor no longer needs to call
    the mail program as a command to /bin/sh.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Fri, 24 Oct 2008 14:37:19 +0200
    
stealth (1.47.1)
    
  * Defined the --max-get-size option to restrict the size of files
    that can be received from a target system. By default 10M.

  * As the MD5 hash is no longer considered to be cryptographically
    secure, stealth users should now use an alternative way to compute
    hash-values. It is suggested to switch to SHA1 hash computations. All
    stealth documentation was updated accordingly.

stealth (1.46.1)

  * Introduced sub-sub-version numbers for minor changes
 
  * The `build' script no longer automatically strips the binary

stealth (1.46)

  * Stealth's icmake scripts adapted to work with icmake > V 7.00 as well.

  * Random interval based activation time clarified and implementation
    slightly changed. Man-page and manual changed accordingly

    Examples now have `find' options (like -xdev) at their proper places.

  * Provded the stealthmail script with a sorting filter, filtering only the
    ADDED, MODIFIED and DELETED messages from mail generated by stealth.

  * Version distribution changed. Latest version now expected in VERSION

stealth (1.45)

  * The previously used scripts below make/ are obsolete and were removed from
    this and future distributions. Icmake should be used instead, for which a
    top-level script (build) and support scripts in the ./icmake/ directory
    are available. Icmake is available on a great many architectures. See the
    file INSTALL (and INSTALL.im, replacing the previously used INSTALL.cf)
    for further details.

  * All plain `unsigned' variables were changed to `size_t'

stealth (1.44) unstable; urgency=low

  * License changed to the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE. See the file
    `copyright'. 

  * Introduced George Danchev <danchev@spnet.net> as uploader

  * From now on this file will contain the `upstream' changes. The Debian
    related changes are in changelog.Debian.gz

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Wed, 19 Jul 2006 12:57:17 +0200

stealth (1.43) unstable; urgency=low

  * Following suggestions made by George Danchev, this version was compiled by
    the unstable's g++ compiler (version >= 4.1), which unveiled several flaws
    in the library's class header files. These flaws were removed (i.e.,
    repaired).

  * In order to facilitate compiler selection, the compiler to use is defined
    in the INSTALL.cf file.

  * The debian control-files (i.e., all files under the debian subdirectory)
    were removed from the source distribution, which is now also named in
    accordance with the Debian policy. A diff.gz file was added.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Thu,  6 Jul 2006 12:24:58 +0200

stealth (1.42) unstable; urgency=low

  * When a (remote) CHECK command failed to return 0, Stealth didn't properly
    terminate. This was repaired by changing the return value of
    Reporter::relax() to type bool, returning d_continue. This return value is
    now checked in Monitor::control(). If not true, the Monitor::control()
    loop terminates, thus terminating the program with exit value 1.

  * make/install script now defines PREFIX=/ if called without argument.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Mon, 26 Jun 2006 09:27:34 +0200

stealth (1.41c) unstable; urgency=low

  * Stealth was `lintianized' and `lindanized'. The info in debian's control
    file was adapted. As the bobcat libraries are now in libbobcat1 *packages,
    stealth's dependencies were adapted accordingly.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.broken@rug.nl>  Sun, 28 May 2006 12:39:15 +0200

stealth (1.41b) unstable; urgency=low

  * Recompilation because of changes in the bobcat library.
    This version of Stealth depends on bobcat 1.7.0.
    No changes to Stealth itself. The compilation dependency for the
    g++ compiler has been restored.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Tue,  2 May 2006 21:37:31 +0200

stealth (1.41a) unstable; urgency=low

  * Minor changes to the make/library script, adapted the program's release
    years. Dependency check in debian/control for g++ removed since it fails
    for unkown reasons. The version should be >= 4.0.2

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Wed,  1 Feb 2006 12:46:01 +0100

stealth (1.41) unstable; urgency=low

  * Library requirement up-to-date: bobcat 1.6.0

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Mon, 26 Dec 2005 19:17:24 +0100

stealth (1.40) unstable; urgency=low

  * all local Pattern objects are now static data members

  * removed: superfluous stealth.doc-base; debugmacro;
    classes arg, configfile, errno fdout fork ifdnbuf pattern pipe selector
    (now in bobcat)
    
  * Renamed all .h2 headers to my standard .ih names:
            util, configsorter, reporter scanner
    
  * Reporter::reset() now calls Reporter::rewind()
    
  * Reporter uses d_hasMail data member instead of d_sizeBeyondHeader:
    d_hasMail can simply be set to false following the writing of the header,
    and then to true at each sync() command.
    
  * added: Reporter::exit(), first inserting the message into the reporter,
    then to cerr, and exiting.
    
  * fatal error messages are no longer suppressed with -q

  * man(ual) pages adapted accordingly.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Mon, 26 Dec 2005 18:23:25 +0100

stealth (1.35) unstable; urgency=low

  * Recompilation using g++-4.0. Requires bobcat >= 1.4.0

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Sat, 19 Nov 2005 16:47:28 +0100

stealth (1.34) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed dependencies on `icmake'. See the file `INSTALL' for details about
    compiling and installing `stealth' from the source package, rather than
    from the binary (.deb) package. 
    Stealth's functionality has not been altered.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Sun,  4 Sep 2005 15:11:46 +0200

stealth (1.33) unstable; urgency=low

  * With the advent of the bobcat library (Brokken's Own Base Classes And
    Templates) various classes were removed from stealth's distribution: Arg,
    Configfile, Errno, Fork, Hashclasses, Ifdstreambuf, Ofdbuf, Pattern, and
    Pipe. Also, the manual pages were adapted to reflect the fact that I'm
    distributing Debian (source and binary) packages, rather than pure source
    packages. No further change in functionality was implemented. To compile
    stealth bobcat-dev is required, to run the binary bobcat itself. See
    http://bobcat.sourceforge.net and http://sourceforge.net/projects/bobcat
    for further information about bobcat.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Sat, 20 Aug 2005 15:35:32 +0200

stealth (1.32) unstable; urgency=low

  * Version 1.31 was not distributed. Version 1.32 offers identical user
    options as V 1.31, but has some minor internal improvements in its code
    over 1.31. In particular, a running stealth process will signal its
    suppressor that it's ready. This simplifies the construction of, e.g., 
    logrotate scripts.

  * Note btw that the date and timestamps in this file are CET (+ DST when
    active)

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Mon,  1 Aug 2005 10:49:36 +0200

stealth (1.31) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added --suspend and --resume options allowing logfile rotations on a
    keepalive running stealth process. Changed the manual page using standard
    manpage*() macros instead of SUBST()s

  * Internally, a Monitor class was added, exercising and taking over  much of
    the control functionality of the Scanner class

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Sat, 30 Jul 2005 00:13:14 +0200

stealth (1.30-2a) unstable; urgency=low

  * Stupid: forgot to update the program's version itself :-( 
    Now it's 1.30-2a

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Tue, 27 Apr 2004 17:56:54 +0200

stealth (1.30-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Repaired bug in Scanner::Scanner():
    The process-id's of the SH and SSH programs were assigned before
    IOFORK::fork() was executed, so they received undefined values. This was
    repaired by assigning the d_shPid and d_sshPid assignments to the
    Scanner::preamble() function.

  * Also, the call to killChildren() at the end of stealth's main() function
    (in stealth.cc) was superfluous, as the atexit() call in preamble already
    ensures that the childprocesses are called.

  * Finally, the Yodl manual files are adapted to Yodl V. >= 2.00. The
    /usr/local/share/yodl/macros.yo file isn't required anymore, and the
    XXsloppyhfuzz undefinition was changed into a call of nosloppyhfuzz().

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Tue, 27 Apr 2004 17:39:17 +0200

stealth (1.30-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * --keep-alive, --terminate and --rerun require the name of a file in which 
    the process id of the running stealth process is stored. This file will be
    writen when the --keep-alive flag is used, read by the other two and
    removed by the corresponding stealth process when it terminates. Manpages
    and docs updated accordingly.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Wed, 17 Dec 2003 09:21:11 +0100

stealth (1.30) unstable; urgency=low

  * --terminate, --rerun, --repeat and --keep-alive flags were added to allow
    stealth to keep an existing connection for longer periods of
    time. Manpages and docs updated accordingly

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Fri, 12 Dec 2003 12:45:45 +0100

stealth (1.22-0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added GET and PUT. Put allows stealth to put files to the client using
    the existing ssh connection.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Wed, 26 Nov 2003 21:25:02 +0100

stealth (1.21-0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added the GET command, allowing stealth to retrieve files from the client
    for, e.g., local inspection, without requiring an additional ssh
    connection.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Sat, 22 Nov 2003 13:55:40 +0100

stealth (1.20-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * New buildscripts added for man(ual) pages. This file will take over from
    CHANGELOG which logged the original, non-Debian distribution. 

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rc.rug.nl>  Fri, 20 Jun 2003 17:21:42 +0200

stealth (1.20-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Release.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rc.rug.nl>  Wed, 18 Jun 2003 12:13:41 +0200
