BASE=/usr
    # BASE=is the directory below which ALL stealth files will be stored.
    #
    # For an operational non-Debian installation, you probably must be `root',
    # and BASE=/usr or BASE=/usr/local is suggested. `BASE' itself is not used
    # outside of this file, so feel free to define BIN, SKEL, MAN and DOC in
    # any which way you like.

BIN=${BASE}/sbin
    # the directory in which stealth will be stored

MAN=${BASE}/share/man/man1
    # MAN is the directory in which the manual page will be stored

DOC=${BASE}/share/doc/stealth
    # DOC is the directory in which all other documentation will be stored

COMPILER=g++
    # COMPILER specifies the compiler to use. Stealth is coined as
    # belonging to the Debian `unstable' distribution, which may use a
    # different version of the compiler you currently have in your
    # system. E.g., in july 2006 the Debian `testing' version of the compiler
    # was 4.0.4, but the `unstable' version's compiler was 4.1.2. By defining
    # COMPILER as COMPILER=g++-4.1 (i.e., uncomment the next definition of
    # `COMPILER') the 4.1.x version of the compiler is used (of course,
    # it must have been installed in your system as well). If you want to use
    # your `standard' C++ compiler, simply remove the next line.
COMPILER=g++-4.1
