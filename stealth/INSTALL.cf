BASE=/usr
    # BASE=is the directory below which ALL stealth files will be stored.
    #
    # For an operational non-Debian installation, you probably must be `root',
    # and BASE=/usr or BASE=/usr/local is suggested. `BASE' itself is not used
    # outside of this file, so feel free to define BIN, SKEL, MAN and DOC in
    # any which way you like.

BIN=${BASE}/sbin
    # the directory in which stealth will be stored

SKEL=${BASE}/share/stealth
    # SKEL is the directory in which the skeleton files will be stored

MAN=${BASE}/share/man/man1
    # MAN is the directory in which the manual page will be stored

DOC=${BASE}/share/doc/stealth
    # DOC is the directory in which all other documentation will be stored
